Post Processing of ice/ocean tripole to regular lat lon

Three steps:
1) Generate the tripole fixed grid containing all stagger locations
and their vertices

2) Generate the interpolation weights to go from stagger locations to 
center locations and from center locations to regular lat lon. The
unstagger weights can be checked with check_weights.ncl

Steps 1 and 2 need be done only once for a given tripole grid

3) Regrid the fields
