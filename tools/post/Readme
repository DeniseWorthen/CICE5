This script shows an initial attempt to post-process the CICE5 history files from
tripole to rectilinear grids. It currently does not give correct results because
I am pointing to an old remap file.  

It can be run by just giving the directory where the history files reside, for
example: 

ncl < postice.ncl 'dirname="/scratch3/NCEPDEV/stmp1/Denise.Worthen/Benchtest/"'

The script will loop over all files in that directory starting with the name "ice".
The files will then be written to a subdirectory of dirname (called in this case
"025") to indicate they are regridded to 1/4 degree; "025" is also appended to the
filename
